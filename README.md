# Product-card-component

A product preview card component using html and css

# Coding challenge from Frontend Mentors

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) This challenge was inspired by the frontend Mentor to help me get better at coding and designs.

# Challenge

-The challenge waa to build a product preview card component and to design it, to look as close as the one that was given.
-I used css grid to make it both desktop and mobile responsive and used a custom color and a normal font to build the project.

-   This challenge took me 2hours straight and to be honest i'm still not as good building little projects like this. But i hope to get better as i go on.
